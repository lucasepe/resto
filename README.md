> A minimalist CLI REST client that calls APIs, waits for conditions, and retries intelligently.

## Overview

`resto` is a tool that allows you to make HTTP calls with retry capability. 

While it can be used for general retry scenarios, it‚Äôs especially useful when you need to ensure that a REST API returning JSON objects has marked those objects with a desired condition or status.

`resto` lets you retry requests until a specified jq condition evaluates to true. 

This feature is particularly handy when working with objects managed by Kubernetes APIs, for example, but it‚Äôs broadly applicable to any REST API that accepts an operation and then updates the resource‚Äôs status accordingly.

Makes scripting and automation of REST API calls simpler and more reliable
in CI/CD pipelines and development workflows.
